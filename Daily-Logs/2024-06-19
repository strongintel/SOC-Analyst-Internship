Description

	•	Module 2: Firewalls:
	•	Explored different types of firewalls, including packet-filtering, stateful, and application-layer firewalls.
	•	Discussed how firewalls control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
	•	UTM (Unified Threat Management):
	•	Learned about UTM devices that integrate multiple security features into a single hardware or software appliance.
	•	Covered features such as firewall, anti-virus, anti-spam, content filtering, and intrusion detection/prevention.
	•	IPS/IDS:
	•	Studied Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
	•	Understood how IPS/IDS work to detect and prevent potential security threats in real-time.
	•	Encryption:
	•	Delved into encryption techniques used to secure data both at rest and in transit.
	•	Discussed symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption, and key management practices.
	•	Lunch:
	•	Took a break for lunch to recharge for the afternoon sessions.
	•	Virus/Attacks/Threats:
	•	Learned about different types of malware, including viruses, worms, and trojans.
	•	Discussed various cyber attacks such as phishing, DDoS, and man-in-the-middle attacks.
	•	Explored threat detection and mitigation strategies.
	•	Module 2 Review:
	•	Participated in a group discussion to review key concepts from Module 2, including firewalls, UTM, IPS/IDS, encryption, and malware.
	•	Self Study:
	•	Engaged in self-study to reinforce understanding of Module 2 topics.
	•	Completed additional readings and practice exercises on cybersecurity fundamentals.

Tools/Technologies Used

	•	Firewall configuration tools (e.g., pfSense, Cisco ASA)
	•	UTM devices (e.g., Fortinet FortiGate)
